THis will the current directory we will be working.
Everyone would have have to work on one of the modules and we just import it.
Which makes Integration easier.
Follow the convention of other files to avoid errors. please don't add pycache, lexerop , parsertab.py etc files into this. Let this folder have only the source code files

Done with Loops.
foreach loop-Requires arrays.
            -So I just wrote the grammar and the basic conversion
All other loops work fine.
But could have missed some conditions.

Done with conditional statements.
I haven't figured out a way to handle cases like when the user enters an else condition before an If.
Otherwise if the syntax is right the statement get's converted properly.
